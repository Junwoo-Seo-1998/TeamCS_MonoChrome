- Personal Notes(optional):
I learnt a lot during this semester's team project.

First, it is hard to design a successful gameplay, and even if gameplay design is done, level designs are real trouble.
I feel like our game still needs more levels, but couldn't make them on time in most of the cases.

Next, lacking a lot on programming skills is a problem, but doesn't mean I cannot do anything.
Compared to my teammates, my work on implementing and programming is quite underwhelming.
Of course, this is a problem I need to solve, but I still can be helpful if I work hard enough.

Last, I need more active communication and suggestions when designing.
This was the first time I actually worked as a designer, and I realized how much I lack on creativity, and
never felt satisfaction about my work.
I need more ideas, and more opinions about what I'm working on, and manage my problems with other people.
